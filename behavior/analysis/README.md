# acc_beat_contrast4.m
checking the beat triggered behavior of rats. The jerk value around on beat timing and off beat timing is calcurated, and contrast between them is calcurated. (Fig.1D-F)

# acc_beat_contrast4_human.m
checking the beat triggered behavior of humans. The code structure is basically the same as acc_beat_contrast3.m. (Fig.S3)

# acc_beat_contrast4_human_video.m
Analysing the video data of human experiment with video recording. (Fig.S1A, S1B)

# jerk_hist_human.m
Analysing the jerk data of human experiment with video recording. (Fig.S1C)

# peak_rat_human4.m
checking the acceleration raw data.  The jerk value around on beat sound is taken into account. This code is for making video clip and extracting beat synchronous behavior. (Fig.2, Fig.S4)

# raw_beat_contrast4.m
Checking the daily difference of jerk beat contrast of rats. (Fig.1C, 1G)

# peak_hist_rat.m
The weighted histogram of jerk in each anlge. (Fig. S2)

# set_border4.m
creating the null distribution for statistical test.
