# acc_beat_contrast4.m
checking the beat triggered behavior of rats. The jerk value around on beat timing and off beat timing is calcurated, and contrast between them is calcurated. (Fig.1d-f)

# acc_beat_contrast4_human.m
checking the beat triggered behavior of humans. The code structure is basically the same as acc_beat_contrast3.m. (Extended Data Fig. 1)

# acc_beat_contrast4_human.m
Analysing the video data of human experiment. 

# peak_rat_human4.m
checking the acceleration raw data.  The jerk value around on beat sound is taken into account. This code is for making video clip and extracting beat synchronous behavior. (Fig. 2)

# raw_checker4.m
Checking the daily difference of jerk beat contrast of rats. (Fig. 1g)

# set_border4.m
creating the null distribution for statistical test.
